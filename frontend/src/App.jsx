THOUGHTS

LEAVING OFF HERE:


HOW TO HANDLE FIXED CHARS
    - if typed CORRECT key
        - if char was already correct -> do nothing
        - if char was already wrong -> move to fixed
        - if char was already fixed -> do nothing
        - if char is not in any status array yet -> add to correct
    - if typed WRONG key
        - if char was already correct -> move to missed
        - if char was already wrong -> do nothing
        - if char was already fixed -> move to missed
        - if char is not in any status array yet -> add to wrong


    - ONCE WE KNOW THIS WORKS, CONVERT THE CHAR STATUS ARRAYS INTO ARRAYS OF IDS ONLY

TODO:
    - [X] find a way to add keyPressed to missed keys
    - [ ] 💀 daaaaamnn -- must remember last line's tab depth and recall it on next line
    - [ ] 💀 deal with scrolling the text if it doesn't fit in the window


TODO FIXES:
    - when backspace from beginning of a line, 
    skip the prev line's last char (\n)
